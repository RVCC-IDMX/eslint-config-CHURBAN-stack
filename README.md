## Let's Learn a VS Code Setting

Within the application VSCode there is a setting callled "editor.formatOnSave". When you have your file open in VSCode the formatter will run every time you save your work/file. This life saving feature within VSCode ensures that the code you are working on is easy to read without having the need to run the files through any manual options such as prettifers that can be found through the extensions found within VSCode or install the extension of a code linter which can be found at the left side of your VSCode application. With format on save you must only work with a pre-installed formatter. While the editor is open make sure that the formatter doesn't close. In the event of loss of power then the VSCode application setting format on save will not perform as its intended to. The user can choose whether to format the entire file or just a portion of their work. The takeaway here is that no matter where you are in the country the application VSCode has format on save settings applied already no matter what coding language you are using.

## Let's Learn an ESLaaint Rule

The reason why "no-trailing-spaces" rule is important because while a user is working and adjusting their files, they will end up finishing their work/file and then there will be whitespaces added to the end of lines. Whitespaces can be read by both by Git and GitHub. Whitespaces majority of the time causes developers to get stressed and then anxiety rises. With the addition of the extra whitespaces the code can still be read without any issues. But with that being said numerous coding conventions make it mandatory to remove the trailing spaces before proceeding/checking in.
This rule is important since it gets rid of unneeded trailing whitespaces found within your work/files that you create. Meaning this rule is helpful since it gets rid of unneeded tabs/spaces and other Unicode found at the end of your lines in your files.
